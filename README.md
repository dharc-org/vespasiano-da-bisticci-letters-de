# Vespasiano da Bisticci's *Letters*

A knowledge site

## About
Vespasiano da Bisticci’s *Letters* are a series of manuscript letters that were sent to and received by *Vespasiano da Bisticci* (1421–1498), an Italian humanist and librarian, over a time period spanning from 1444 to 1497. Their content focuses mostly on manuscripts and codex trade with other notable people of that time. From the letters it is possible to learn many relevant features of these manuscripts: materials, copyists, costs, but also names of latin, greek and humanistic authors and texts.

A [**knowledge site**](http://projects.dharc.unibo.it/vespasiano/) of the Letters has been developed in order to facilitate the navigation, study and conservation of such documents, as well as to contextualize them in a semantically-rich and metatextual framework.
